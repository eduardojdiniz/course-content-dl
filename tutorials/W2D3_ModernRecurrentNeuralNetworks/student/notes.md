# Tutorial 1 - Modeling sequences and encoding text

Markov Models: What if the state changes over time?

Maybe all systems can be well approximated by a markov process once you learn the right features (the right latent space).

A good example of a hidden Markov model process in speech is: hidden state (meaning), observable (written text).

Skip-gram looks like the anchor/positive/negative trainning we saw for faces yesterday (W2D2).

Embeddings, i.e., semantic meaning
